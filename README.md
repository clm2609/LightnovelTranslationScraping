# LightnovelTranslationScraping
Im scraping Lightnovel translations so I can transform them to epub and read them in my ebook.

Simply copy the repo and execute the scrap.py of the series you want (the directory with the name of the series). The script will proceed to download the chapters/volumes (or even both). I do not convert to any format, just plain text.
